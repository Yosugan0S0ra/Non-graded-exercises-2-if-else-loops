    "Write a simple game with the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print a welcome message that says \"Welcome to Hangman\"\n",
    "2. Store a list of different words that can be used in the game. When the game starts, pick one word randomly. For now, use a list of only single words. \n",
    "3. Display that random word to the user, but display it only as '_' (underscores). e.g., if the word is 'Alice', then only _ _ _ _ _ should be displayed. \n",
    "3. Keep asking the user to guess the word one letter at a time until either the user guesses it correctly, or they run out of total 10 attempts. \n",
    "    3.1. Print how many attempts are left\n",
    "    3.2. Print the current state of the guessed word\n",
    "    3.3. Ask the user enter a single letter\n",
    "    3.4 Every time the user enters something, check that the input is only alphabet and not numbers or special characters. If the user enters such a character, tell the user \"Invalid Character\" and ask the user to try again. \n",
    "    3.5. Keep track of all the letters that the user has entered while playing the game\n",
    "    3.6. If the user enters a letter that was already entered before, inform the user. \n",
    "    3.7. Every time the user makes an incorrect guess, the number of total attempts must be decreased by 1. \n",
    "    3.8. Every time the user makes a correct guess, inform the user that it was correct, fill the word with that letter and continue. For example, if the user enters 'i' when trying to guess the word 'Alice', display to the user _ _ i _ _\n",
    "    3.9 If the entire word has been guessed correctly, display the message \"Awesome! You guessed the word correctly\".\n",
    "4. After the game ends, display \"Thank you for playing. See you next time\" if the user was able to guess the word correctly. Otherwise, display \"Thank you for playing. Better luck next time\" if the user could not guess the word and the number of total attempts is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "After your have finished writing the program and it works flawlessly, you can COMMIT and then PUSH your program to your GitHub acccount. Then copy that repository link and submit it to \"Non-graded Exercise #2: If-else and Loops\" submission box\n",
    "\n",
    "*** If you still have time and want to try something more, try using a list of multiple words that may have numbers and even special characters. For example, \"Oh, my God!\"\n",
    "1. 打印 “欢迎来到刽子手 ”的欢迎词\n",
    "2. 存储游戏中可使用的不同单词列表。游戏开始时，随机选择一个单词。现在，只使用单个单词列表。\n",
    "3. 例如，如果单词是 “Alice”，则只显示 _ _ _ _ _。\n",
    "3. 每次让用户猜一个字母，直到用户猜对或猜完 10 次为止。\n",
    "    3.1. 打印还剩多少次尝试\n",
    "    3.2. 打印所猜单词的当前状态\n",
    "    3.3. 要求用户输入一个字母\n",
    "    3.4 每次用户输入时，检查输入的是否只是字母，而不是数字或特殊字符。如果用户输入了此类字符，则告诉用户 “字符无效”，并要求用户重试。\n",
    "    3.5. 记录用户在玩游戏时输入的所有字母\n",
    "    3.6. 如果用户输入了之前已经输入过的字母，请告知用户。\n",
    "    3.7. 用户每猜错一次，总尝试次数就必须减少一次。\n",
    "    3.8. 用户每猜对一次，就通知用户猜对了，并用该字母填词，然后继续。例如，如果用户在猜测单词 “Alice ”时输入了 “i”，则向用户显示 _ _ i _ _ 。\n",
    "    3.9 如果整个单词都猜对了，则显示信息 \"真棒！您猜对了单词\"。\n",
    "4. 游戏结束后，如果用户猜对了单词，则显示 \"谢谢您的参与。如果用户猜对了单词，则显示 \"Thank you for playing. 否则，显示 \"谢谢您的游戏。如果用户无法猜出单词，且总尝试次数为 0，则显示 “谢谢您的游戏，祝您下次好运”。\n",
    "\n",
    "完成程序编写并完美运行后，可以 COMMIT 并将程序推送到 GitHub 账户。然后复制该仓库链接，并将其提交到 “无评分练习 #2：If-else 和循环 ”提交框中。\n",
    "\n",
    "*** 如果你还有时间并想尝试更多，可以尝试使用一个包含多个单词的列表，其中可能包含数字甚至特殊字符。例如，“哦，我的上帝！”。"
